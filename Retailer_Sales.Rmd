## Context 

Sales analysis is the process of integrating, analyzing, and understanding various data related to sales activities such as sales, customers, and transaction data. Understanding revenue-driving metrics is important to the company because it allows for informed decisions to be made about pricing and product development, sales strategies, target markets, and much more.


## Data Contents 


* **Order ID** - An Order ID is the number system that Amazon uses exclusively to keep track of orders. Each order receives its own Order ID that will not be duplicated. This number can be useful to the seller when attempting to find out certain details about an order such as shipment date or status.
* **Product** - The product that have been sold.
* **Quantity Ordered** - Ordered Quantity is the total item quantity ordered in the initial order (without any changes).
* **Price Each** - The price of each products.
* **Order Date** - This is the date the customer is requesting the order be shipped.
* **Purchase Address** - The purchase order is prepared by the buyer, often through a purchasing department. The purchase order, or PO, usually includes a PO number, which is useful in matching shipments with purchases; a shipping date; billing address; shipping address; and the request items, quantities and price.

## Objectives 

* What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
* What City had the highest number of sales?
* What time should we display advertisement to maximize likelihood of customer's buying product?
* What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?

#### What was the best month for sales and how much was earned that month?

![best_month](best.month.png)

December was the best month for sales where the number of products sold reached 28,074. $4,613,443 was earned in the month of December. 


#### Which city had the highest number of sales?

![city.sales](city_sales.png) 


The city of San Francisco had the highest number of sales. 



#### What time should we display advertisement to maximize likelihood of customer's buying product?

![ten](ten.png)
 

The company should display ads between the hours of **10 AM and 11 AM** as well as **4 PM and 5 PM**. This is because these are the hours before peak sale times for products. (interactive version of graph is available upon request)

#### What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?
```{r  echo=FALSE}
Most_Sold <- df %>% group_by(Product) %>% dplyr::count( Product)
Most_Sold <- Most_Sold%>% arrange(desc(n)) %>% head(5)
Most_Sold$n <-  format(Most_Sold$n, big.mark = ",", scientific = FALSE)
colnames(Most_Sold)[2] <- "Amount Sold"

knitr::kable(Most_Sold)
```


 From the table above it shows that the USB-C charging cable sold the most. I believe it sold the most because it is an accessory to a main product like a Google phone or the Bose sound sport headphones. The top five items sold are accessories needed for other products that customers may have purchased.
